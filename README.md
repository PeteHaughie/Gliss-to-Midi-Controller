# Gliss to Midi Controller

This CV to CC midi controller is for the Seeeduino Xiao SAMD21 microcontroller but should work on any Arduino compatible device that has 8 0 â€“ 5v analog input pins.

The device is intended to have each pin driven by a 3.5mm jack but if all you want to do is test it before committing you can also just as easily drive each pin from the microcontroller's 5v pin and a potentiometer for each pin instead (which is how I tested it).
